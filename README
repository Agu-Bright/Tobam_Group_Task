This project provides a simple API for handling image uploads and retrievals. It includes two main endpoints:

1. **POST /upload:** Upload an image, process it, and save it to a MongoDB database.
2. **GET /get_image/:id:** Retrieve a saved image from the database using its secure URL.

## Introduction

## Features

- Image upload and processing.
- Secure retrieval of saved images through unique URLs.
- MongoDB integration for data storage.
